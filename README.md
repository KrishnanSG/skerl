## What can skerl do?
   - Parse and tokenize the given command
   - Execute any given program
   - Maintains history of all commands for quick access
   - Input redirection
```
eg: /home/user$ wc -l < story.txt
```
   - Output redirection
```
eg: /home/user$ ls > out.txt
/home/user$ ls >> out.txt	// append mode
```
   - Pipes
```
eg: /home/user$ cat story.txt | wc -l 
```
   - Execute process in background when suffixed with (&)
```
eg: /home/user$ program.o -arg1 -arg2 &
``` 
   - Provides stats on usage of shell. Try out the following internal commands.
```
globalusage
averageusage
```

## How does this work?
This is a really interesting section as developer you would love to visit. Keeping this in mind we have provide a pretty detailed explaination.
